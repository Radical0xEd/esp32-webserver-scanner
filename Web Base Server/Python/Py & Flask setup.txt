If youâ€™re comfortable with Python, Flask is a lightweight and powerful framework for web servers.

a. Install Flask
bash:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install flask
b. Create a Flask App
Create a file named app.py:

(See app.py)

Create a public folder in the same directory and save your index.html there.

Run the server:

bash:

python3 app.py
Access it at http://localhost:5000.

Wi-Fi Connection:

The ESP32 connects to your specified Wi-Fi network.
Update ssid and password with your Wi-Fi credentials.
HTTP Requests:

scanNetworks(): Sends a GET request to /api/scan.
sniffTraffic(): Sends a GET request to /api/sniff.
downloadLogs(): Sends a POST request to /api/logs.
updateSettings(): Sends a POST request to /api/settings.
Server Address:

Replace 192.168.1.100 with the IP address of your computer running the Flask app.
Logs:

Responses from the Flask server are printed to the Serial Monitor.
Setup Notes
Make sure the Flask server and the ESP32 are on the same network.
If your server address is dynamic, consider using mDNS or a static IP for your server.
To test this setup:
Start the Flask app (python3 app.py).
Upload this code to the ESP32.
Open the Serial Monitor to see the interaction.
